# openbci-blinkdetector
Uses EEG and binary classifier to predict when eyes are open or closed


This is my first ever project with the OpenBCI electrode cap.
It uses a binary classifier with pytorch to classify brain data from the EEG
and determine if the user has their eyes opened or closed.

#Dependancies:

Pytorch
OpenBCI Python
OpenBCI electrode cap + Cyton Board + Daisy (16 channels)
